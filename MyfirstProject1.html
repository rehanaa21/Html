                A hospital is a healthcare institution providing patient treatment with specialized
                 health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.
                  The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency
                   department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a
                    sudden illness.
